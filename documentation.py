## 1.1.1 Background

The aim of this project is to publicize and promote a real life problem, in
this case, poluted rivers, lakes and others, by creating a responsive website.
The website will focus on promoting campaigns and different types of 
events that volunteers will take part in to clean certain riverssides that 
are severely poluted. In addition to that the website will have the function
to accept donations that will help acquire the needed equpment to purify water
and clean river sides.

The main idea of the campaign is that people voluntarily agree to participate
in the different events. Because of that, sharing this problem online is a 
great idea for advertisement. This is a great way to get a bigger number
of people to see and discuss a certain problem. Another big reason is that 
all of the people that are already interested, might want to learn more about
the organisation and its' campaigns. What better way than displaying all of 
the relevant and important information on the website. That way everyone
can get educated about business of the company without having to spend 
a great amount of research.

Last but not least, the website will serve as a comminity platform, where 
people can join and receive information about upcomming events,which will help
them be more active and talk openly about anything concerning the clenliness
of local river.

## 1.1.3 Color scheme
The colors used were mainly blue-#0000FF, white-#FFFFFF, green-#008000.
The reason behind the use of these colors was to make a feeling clenliness, 
also these colors are mainly seen in nature, like trees, rivers and others , 
thats why the user will get a good idea of what the website offers and what
it promotes.

## 1.1.4 Accessibility

Accessibility is a very important issue to be accounted nowadays in websites,
since not all are able to see or hear elements from a certain website.
In my website I included an "alt" attribute which helps blind people listen,
to a short description of a given image, in this case the logo.
